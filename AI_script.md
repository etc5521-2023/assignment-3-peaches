ME: I have a data set of woylie sightings with the date of the sighting and the coordinates(latitude and longitude) of each. All the sightings seem to be clustered into 5 nature parks. How can I find the the park with the most sightings  by counting each of the woylie sightings in the vicintiy of each park

CHATEGPT: To group the sightings into 5 clusters based on proximity, considering a 100 km radius for each cluster, you can follow these steps:

Initialize Clusters:
Start by initializing 5 empty clusters, each representing a potential park or grouping.

Iterate Through Sightings:
For each woylie sighting, calculate the distance from the sighting coordinates to the centroid of each existing cluster. If the distance to any cluster is within 100 km, add the sighting to that cluster. If the distance exceeds 100 km for all clusters, create a new cluster for that sighting.

Update Cluster Centroids:
After adding a sighting to a cluster, update the centroid of that cluster to be the new mean location of the sightings within that cluster.

Repeat Iteration:
Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no more sightings change clusters.

ME: How can I remove duplicate values in R?

CHATGPT: To remove duplicate values in a column of a data frame in R, you can use the dplyr package, which is a powerful tool for data manipulation. Specifically, you can use the distinct() function to remove duplicates based on a specific column.

```
# Create lineup
lineup(create_qqplot(data.frame(x = rnorm(100))), 
       create_qqplot(data.frame(x = observed_data)),
       n = 20)
```

ANALYSIS: ChatGPT helped me to start in certain areas. It rarely provided useful code.
