<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>The Brush-Tailed Bettong or Woylie (Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi) is a remarkable Australian marsupial with unique characteristics. It thrives in a diverse range of habitats, including forests, woodlands, and shrublands, where dense vegetation offers shelter and sustenance. This nocturnal creature is most active during the night and rests in leafy grass nests during the day. Unfortunately, the Woylie has faced a perilous decline, with its population plummeting by more than 90% in the past two centuries. This decline can be attributed to various factors, including habitat loss, introduced predators, and disease. Consequently, the Woylie is currently classified as a critically endangered species, receiving protection from the Australian government. Most of the remaining Woylie population resides in wildlife sanctuaries, where they can live free from predators.The allure of encountering unique creatures in the wild has given rise to ecotourism, a sustainable form of tourism that emphasizes personal experiences with nature and promotes conservation. Given the Woylie’s elusive nature, our analysis seeks to understand the relationship between Woylie sightings and tourist visits</p>

Expectations for sightings and weather data
</div>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>From this data we expect the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li>We expect to observe a decline in Woylie occurrences over the past 20 years, reflecting their critically endangered status.</li>
<li>The dataset is likely to show fewer sightings in the wild over recent years, given that Woylies are mostly found in protected sanctuaries.</li>
<li>Woylies are expected to have limited sightings near weather stations, as their habitat preferences are specific to certain regions within Australia.</li>
<li>We anticipate a seasonal pattern in sightings, with more occurrences during specific times of the year, possibly correlating with breeding seasons or favorable climate conditions.</li>
<li>It is unlikely that there will be a significant number of sightings in urban areas, as Woylies tend to avoid human-populated regions due to habitat disturbance.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>In our report we first analyse records from <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/">Atlas of Living Australia (ALA)</a> database and check if they match our expectations, we also explore how weather is related to when Woylie sightings occur and find the region with most number of Woylie sightings. Further we perform an analysis that delves into the trends of tourism within that region. With respect to our analysis pertaining to the tourism trends, our expectations are as follows:</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<ul>
<li>We expect most of the Woylie sightings to either be in Western or Southern Australia.</li>
<li>We expect most number of holiday trips to be in September through November or March through May.</li>
<li>We expect a seasonal holiday pattern in the region of interest which may consequently lead to higher Woylie sightings.</li>

<p>To ensure a robust foundation for the analysis, occurrence records of the Brush-Tailed Bettong or Woylie (Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi) were obtained from the <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/">Atlas of Living Australia (ALA)</a> database using the functions of the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/galah/index.html">galah</a> R package.</p>
<p>This dataset includes essential information, such as date, time, and collector identification details, and comprises 13 variables and 2,276 observations across Australia as of the current report.</p>

<p>Exploring the correlation between weather conditions and Woylie sightings can yield valuable insights into their behavior. To conduct this analysis, it would be useful to first identify the locations where Woylies are most frequently found and then obtain the weather data from the nearest weather stations.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/global-historical-climatology-network-daily">Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN)</a> database contains weather station data that are valuable for analysing trends in weather patterns and precipitation. This data can be obtained using the <code>rnoaa</code> package.</p>

<p>As demonstrated in <a href="#fig-cluster-map">Figure&nbsp;3</a>, the five closest weather stations are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Weather Station ID: ASN00020028, which is closest to the Danggali Wilderness Protection area.</p></li>
<li><p>Weather Station ID: ASN00023373, which is closest to the Yookamura Private Nature Reserve.</p></li>
<li><p>Weather Station ID: ASN00018192, which is closest to the sightings near Port Lincoln at the Lincoln National Park.</p></li>
<li><p>Weather Station ID: ASN00076031, which is closest to the sightings at Mallee Cliffs National Park.</p></li>
<li><p>Weather Station ID: ASN00054038, located near the sightings at Pilliga East State Forest.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The highest number of Woylie sightings was recorded in Pilliga East State Forest, and as a result, the weather data to be obtained will be from the nearest weather station, which is the Narrabri Airport weather station.</p>

<p>In this section, we will delve into the exploratory data analysis of Woylie sightings, focusing on verifying our expectations through data visualization and analysis. Furthermore, we will evaluate whether visual inference techniques support or contradict our initial assumptions.</p>
<p>Now, let’s move forward with exploring the data visually to acquire meaningful insights into the behavior and distribution of the Woylie.</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure&nbsp;5: The five highest clusters of Woylie sightings.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Leaflet map, initially featured in <a href="#sec-ref">Section&nbsp;3.2</a> and presented again in <a href="#fig-cluster-map-2">Figure&nbsp;5</a>, provides a clear geographic representation of Woylie sightings.</p>
<p>Woylies exhibit distinct habitat preferences across various regions in Australia, and these preferences are closely associated with five specific weather stations: Gluepot Reserve, Nuriootpa Viticultural, North Shields (Port Lincoln Airport), Mildura Airport, and Narrabri Airport. These weather stations correspond to the following National Parks: Danggali Wilderness Protection area, Yookamura Private Nature Reserve, Lincoln National Park, Mallee Cliffs National Park, and Pilliga East State Forest.</p>
<p>The map starkly highlights the significant reduction in Woylie populations, stemming from challenges related to habitat loss and disease. Notably, it demonstrates the success of the population relocation strategy, which aims to guide Woylies towards conservation areas. The majority of Woylie clusters are now concentrated within the National Parks, as shown on the map.</p>
<p>Moreover, the implementation of disease management programs is supported by evidence in <a href="#sec-ref-3">Section&nbsp;4.1.1</a>, which indicates a recent upsurge in Woylie sightings in recent years. This increase can be attributed to the fact that these creatures are more readily observed within National Parks, further underscoring the effectiveness of this conservation approach.</p>

<p><a href="#fig-monthly">Figure&nbsp;6</a> illustrates that the number of Woylie sightings varied throughout the year, but the highest number of sightings occurred in the spring season (between September to Deecem</p>
<p>The provided code filters the dataset to isolate Woylie sightings that occurred exclusively in the year 2022 and subsequently generates a bar chart to visualize the distribution of these sightings across different months.</p>
<p>The resulting bar chart shows that the number of Woylie sightings varied throughout the year, but the highest number of sightings occurred in the spring and summer months (October to March). The lowest number of sightings occurred in the winter months (April to September).</p>
<p>There are a few possible explanations for this pattern. One possibility is that Woylies are more active during the spring and summer months due to the warmer weather and longer days. Another possibility is that there is more food available for Woylies during the spring and summer months. Finally, it is also possible that Woylies are more visible during the spring and summer months because they are spending more time outside.</p>
<p>To delve into the connection between temperature and sightings, you have the option to craft scatter plots or line plots that unveil how temperature variables like ‘tmax’ or ‘tmin’ correlate with the observed number of sightings. Here’s an illustrative instance of crafting a plot:</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Upon analysing the maximum and minimum temperatures on the days of Woylie sightings as illustrated by <a href="#fig-temp">Figure&nbsp;7</a>, we can obseve the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There appears to be lower number of Woylie sightings during the initial months of the year. The initial months in Australia constitute of the summer and is typically characterised by higher than average maximum and minimum temperatures. The low sightings during the summer suggests that the Woylies are not as active on warmer days.</p></li>
<li><p>Between the months of April to August, the number of Woylie sightings are observed to gradually rise. These months are relatively cold in Australia and appear to promote higher mobility among the Woylies.</p></li>
<li><p>There are distinctly higher number of observations from the month of September to December. This coincides with the Australian spring season. Based on the data, we can infer that the spring season appears to be the one promoting the highest activity among the Woylies.</p></li>

<li><p>Post-2018, there seems to be a decline in trips, but it recovers towards 2022.</p></li>
<li><p>Around the years 2005 and 2015, there are evident dips in the number of trips,thus the trips were considerably lower than their surrounding years.</p></li>

<li><p>The number of trips seems to be consistent throughout the earlier years ( 1998-2005), with no significant peaks or troughs across the quarters.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Q1</strong>: Generally, the colors for Q1 across the years seem to be on the lighter side compared to other quarters. This suggests that Q1 typically witnesses fewer trips. 1998-2005 shows a fairly consistent shade for Q1, indicating that the number of trips were fairly consistent during this period for Q1</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Q2</strong> : This quarter appears to have variable trip numbers without a consistent trend, the volume of trips seem similar to Q1 but with some years having higher number of trips</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Q3</strong> : Q3 consistently displays the darkest hues on the heatmap across multiple years, indicating that this quarter usually experiences the highest volume of trips when compared to the other quarters.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Q4</strong> : This quarter appears to have variable trip numbers without a consistent trend. Some years in the early and mid-2010s display darker shades, indicating increased travel activity during that time</p></li>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>Business trips are least frequent in the first quarter and peak in Q2 and Q4. This could imply end-of-year meetings, reviews, or projects that drive increased business travel.</p></li>
<li><p>Visiting-related trips maintain a fairly consistent number throughout the year, suggesting that family or friend visits are evenly spread and not particularly influenced by the season.</p></li>
<li><p>Holiday trips gradually increase from Q1 to Q2 and surge in Q3. There’s a decline in Q4, but it still remains higher than Q1, suggesting an interest in holidays during the latter part of the year.</p></li>
<li><p>Overall, The third quarter (Q3) is the most active period, suggesting factors or events in these months (July to September) that drive an increase in the number of trips. There is a clear progression of activity from Q1 to Q3, starting with the lowest activity in Q1 and gradually increasing to reach its pinnacle in Q3.</p></li>
<li><p>Among the specific purposes, “Visiting” trips dominate, followed by “Holiday” trips. “Business” and “Other” have a relatively lower volume of trips, with “Business” trips being the least common.</p></li>

</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There is a distinct pattern in the number of trips for each of the purposes (Business, Holiday, Other, and Visiting) when analysing the tourism data for the Narrabri region.</p></li>
<li><p>There have been significant periods of time in this region with very low business trips. However, recently, business trips have become more frequent and in higher numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>As expected, typical of many holiday trends, a noticeable seasonality in holiday trips for the Narrabri region becomes apparent. This is further substantiated by the intermediate seasonal strength of around 0.4 observed in <a href="#fig-trendanalysis">Figure&nbsp;12</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Additionally, there seems to be low seasonality in trips related to business, visits, and ‘other’ purposes. This suggests that the patterns of trips in the region for these purposes do not exhibit regular intervals.</p></li>
<li><p>However, there is a moderate trend strength in the overall total trips as well as in visit-related trips, based on the analysis in <a href="#fig-trendanalysis">Figure&nbsp;12</a>. This indicates that the total trips due to visits and the overall total trips in the region have increased over time, particularly in recent years.</p></li>

<li><p>The recent rise in the seasonality of the holiday trips for the Narrabri regions could attributed to the annual 45km <a href="https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/media/OEHMedia16082601.htm">Tour de Gorge bike ride</a> through the Pilliga Nature Reserve which first started in the year 2013.</p></li>

<p>Ecotourism involves traveling to places in support of the conservation efforts of endangered wildlife. To assess the level of interest in ecotourism for the Woylie, an analysis that combines tourism data from <a href="https://www.tra.gov.au">Tourism Research Australia (TRA)</a> and Woylie sightings near the weather station of interest, Narrabri Airport, as reported in <a href="#sec-ref">Section&nbsp;3.2</a>, will provide us with a holistic view. To ensure a more accurate matching of the data with tourism data, the observations of the Woylie are subsetted to focus on the Australian Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) region: Narrabri Surrounds.</p>
<section id="tourism-trend-in-narrabri-surrounds" class="level2" data-number="6.1">
<h2 data-number="6.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tourism-trend-in-narrabri-surrounds"><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Tourism trend in Narrabri Surrounds</h2>
<p>The tourism data will be filtered for the region of Narrabri Surrounds as part of the analysis. The purpose of tourism trips will also be filtered to holiday trips since this suggests the intention to travel for sightseeing and exploration. Other purposes, such as visiting friends and relatives or business, may include visiting the endangered Woylie species during the trip, but the purposes are too broad to draw conclusive insights. Therefore, choosing holiday tourism data will result in the most accurate analysis.</p>

<p>Based on the initial analysis of <a href="#fig-narr">Figure&nbsp;14</a>, the following observations can be made:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The number of trips designated as “holiday” is irregular, with several quarters and years showing no holiday visitors in the region of interest. However, after 2008, trips become more frequent.</li>
<li>Consequently, there is only a moderate seasonality in holiday visits in this region.</li>
<li>The highest number of holiday visitors was recorded in the 3rd quarter of 2001, with nearly 13,445 visits.</li>

<p>When grouping the tourism visit numbers in Narrabri Surrounds by quarter, Quarter 1 experiences the fewest tourists compared to Quarter 3, which receives the most, as can be seen in <a href="#fig-holiday-group">Figure&nbsp;16</a>. Specifically, from January to March, Narrabri Surrounds sees the least tourism, while from July to September, the area has the most tourism.</p>

<p><a href="#fig-woylie-obs">Figure&nbsp;17</a> displays the sightings that occurred in Quarters 3 and 4 of 2022. This recent, short surge in observations is too brief to correspond with the tourism data. This is evident from the highlighted quarter. It was the only quarter where trips involving over a thousand people occurred, which is also noticeable in the last calendar plot in <a href="#fig-holiday-year">Figure&nbsp;15</a>.</p>

Key takeaways
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Based on the analysis of <a href="#fig-woylie-obs">Figure&nbsp;17</a>, the following key observations can be made:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>While the Narrabri region was found to have the highest Woylie sightings in Australia, this was not always the case.</li>
<li>According to the sightings data from the Atlas of Living Australia, Woylie sightings in the Narrabri region were exclusively in the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2022.</li>
<li>Recognising this unique trend in the data, a more in-depth analysis was conducted to identify the underlying cause of this skewed pattern.</li>
<li>According to a detailed report by the <a href="https://www.australianwildlife.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Pilliga-Ecohealth-Report-2022-23.pdf">Australian wildlife organisation</a>, Woylies, <strong>being an endangered species</strong>, are now inhabiting the <strong>protected Pilliga East Forest reserve, located in the Narrabri SA2 region.</strong></li>
<li>A significant number of Woylies were transferred from Western Australia to New South Wales (including the Narrabri region) in 2022, with the <strong>purpose of providing a safe environment for breeding and conservation efforts.</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>special conservation initiatives undertaken by the Australian wildlife organisation,</strong> as mentioned in the points above, are expected to contribute to the <strong>high number of Woylie sightings in the year 2022.</strong></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>Overall, there is a limited relation between these two sets of data. It is evident that tourism in the Narrabri Surrounds area exhibits significant inconsistency and year-to-year variation. The peak in Woylie observations in Narrabri Surrounds toward the end of 2022 can be attributed to conservation efforts for this endangered species, resulting in a notable increase in sightings. However, the lack of alignment between these two time periods hinders further analysis. This suggests that tourism in the area may not be strongly linked to Woylie sightings, ultimately yielding an inconclusive result in terms of ecotourism.</p>
<p>In general, an internet search for terms such as <em>“Pilliga State Conservation Area,”</em> <em>“Pilliga National Park”,</em> <em>“Woylie,”</em> and <em>“Narrabri Surrounds,”</em> or a combination of these terms, yields minimal results related to marketing efforts promoting visits to the area for Woylie sightings.</p>
<p>This aligns with our findings, indicating that there is little to no ecotourism activity in this area for this particular species.</p>

Limitations
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>It is imperative to acknowledge the constraints and limitations encountered during our analysis which have been delineated as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The observations for the Woylie sightings were observed to be extremely skewed towards the year 2022 for the Narrabri region. As a result, the insights generated were for a brief period of time and require more data for further meaningful analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>The tourism data with respect to the Narrabri Surrounds region for the year of 2022 was observed to be extremely limited. The poor quality and availability of the data was observed to pose further challenges so as to ascertain any significant correlation between the tourim and sighting trends.</p></li>

Suggestions
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<ul>
<li><p>While performing a detailed analysis of the Woylie sightings, the data quality was observed to be poor with multiple missing values. The reporting authorities can take note of the challenges faced while performing a detailed analysis with incomplete data.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple observations have been recorded after long periods of time. While this may indicate the elusive behaviour of the Woylies, it is unclear whether this is contributed by the irregular recording of data. Hence, a key suggestion to aid detailed and accurate analyses would be to furnish complete data at regular intervals.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>Future Directions</p>
<p>To further advance our understanding of Woylie behavior and conservation, future research avenues could encompass expanded data collection, enhanced monitoring techniques, and comprehensive studies of habitat quality.</p>
