<p>The Brush-Tailed Bettong or Woylie (Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi) is a remarkable Australian marsupial with unique characteristics. It thrives in a diverse range of habitats, including forests, woodlands, and shrublands, where dense vegetation offers shelter and sustenance. This nocturnal creature is most active during the night and rests in leafy grass nests during the day. Unfortunately, the Woylie has faced a perilous decline, with its population plummeting by more than 90% in the past two centuries. This decline can be attributed to various factors, including habitat loss, introduced predators, and disease. Consequently, the Woylie is currently classified as a critically endangered species, receiving protection from the Australian government. Most of the remaining Woylie population resides in wildlife sanctuaries, where they can live free from predators. While the Woylie is not a common attraction for tourists due to its elusive nature, there are a few places like the Perth Zoo and the Australian Wildlife Conservancy’s Scotia Sanctuary where visitors can catch a glimpse of this unique marsupial.</p>
<p>From this data we expect the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li>“We expect to observe a decline in Woylie occurrences over the past 20 years, reflecting their critically endangered status.”</li>
<li>“The dataset is likely to show fewer sightings in the wild over recent years, given that Woylies are mostly found in protected sanctuaries.”</li>
<li>“Woylies are expected to have limited sightings near weather stations, as their habitat preferences are specific to certain regions within Australia.”</li>
<li>“We anticipate a seasonal pattern in sightings, with more occurrences during specific times of the year, possibly correlating with breeding seasons or favorable climate conditions.”</li>
<li>“It is unlikely that there will be a significant number of sightings in urban areas, as Woylies tend to avoid human-populated regions due to habitat disturbance.”</li>
</ul>

<p>To ensure a robust foundation for our analysis, we obtained the occurrence records of the Brush-Tailed Bettong or Woylie (Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi) from the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA). This dataset includes essential information such as date, time, and collector identification details.</p>

<li>It was determined that only the event dates recorded by the “Western Australian Museum provider for OZCAM” were missing, with all 182 recordings in this category lacking event date information.</li>

<ul>
<li>As previously observed, there were 182 observations recorded by the “Western Australian Museum provider for OZCAM,” and 19 of these recordings had missing values in both the “decimalLongitude” and “decimalLatitude” columns.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will proceed to identify and save only the wild sightings in a structured manner to facilitate further analysis.</p>

<p>Using the leaflet interactive map of the Australia weather stations as well as the map of the map of Woylie sightings (shown below in exploration of geographical locations of Woylie sightings), we identified the closest weather stations to the clusters of woylie sightings.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Weather Station ID: ASN00020028, which is closest to the Danggali Wilderness Protection area.</p></li>
<li><p>Weather Station ID: ASN00023373, which is closest to the Yookamura Private Nature Reserve.</p></li>
<li><p>Weather Station ID: ASN00018192, which is closest to the sightings near Port Lincoln at the Lincoln National Park.</p></li>
<li><p>Weather Station ID: ASN00076031, which is closest to the sightings at Mallee Cliffs National Park.</p></li>
<li><p>Weather Station ID: ASN00054038, located near the sightings at Pilliga East State Forest.</p></li>

<p>In this section, we will delve into the exploratory data analysis of Woylie sightings, focusing on verifying our expectations through data visualization and analysis. Furthermore, we will evaluate whether visual inference techniques support or contradict our initial assumptions.</p>
<p>Now, let’s move forward with exploring the data visually to acquire meaningful insights into the behavior and distribution of the Woylie.</p>

<p>The data presented in our analysis reveals a significant downward trend in Woylie sightings over time. Through a linear regression model, we determined that the slope of the trend line is negative (0.003989), signifying a noticeable decline. The R-squared value of 0.08153 indicates that our model explains a modest yet statistically significant portion of the variance in Woylie sightings.</p>
<p>This trend indicates a concerning decline in Woylie populations, likely attributed to multiple factors such as habitat loss, the presence of introduced predators, and disease. It’s important to emphasize that Woylies are critically endangered, with their population having plummeted by over 90% in the last two centuries.</p>

<p>The observed seasonal pattern in Woylie sightings reveals a distinct trend characterized by an increase in sightings during the spring and summer months, followed by a decline in the autumn and winter months. This intriguing pattern can be attributed to several underlying factors:</p>
<p>Abundance of Food: Woylies primarily subsist on a diet of insects and seeds. The surge in sightings during the warmer seasons correlates with heightened food availability, as both plants and insects flourish during this time.</p>
<p>Breeding Season: Woylies engage in breeding activities during the spring and summer, with newborn pups typically making their debut in late summer and early autumn. During this period, the increased sightings may be a consequence of heightened activity as Woylies nurture their offspring.</p>
<p>Weather Influences: Woylies exhibit adaptations to warmer and drier environmental conditions. Consequently, they may reduce their activity levels during the cooler and wetter autumn and winter months, leading to fewer recorded sightings.</p>
<p>In essence, the observed seasonal pattern in Woylie sightings underscores the species’ ability to adapt to varying environmental conditions throughout the year. These findings shed light on the intricate interplay between Woylie behavior and the changing seasons.”</p>

<p>The analysis of geographical data underscores the sobering reality of the Woylie’s current status, revealing their presence in a limited number of isolated populations within Western Australia and South Australia. Their historical range, once extensive, has seen a significant reduction due to relentless challenges posed by habitat loss, introduced predators, and disease.</p>
<p>The provided map vividly portrays the concentration of remaining Woylie populations, primarily situated in the southwestern regions of Western Australia and the southern Flinders Ranges of South Australia. Additionally, isolated pockets of Woylie populations persist in the central Kimberley region of Western Australia and the Eyre Peninsula of South Australia.</p>
<p>The geographical distribution of Woylies raises profound conservation concerns. The small size and isolation of these populations render them highly susceptible to a spectrum of threats, including potential extinction triggered by unpredictable events like bushfires or disease outbreaks.</p>
<p>To safeguard the future of Woylies and their ecosystems, comprehensive conservation initiatives have been initiated. These multifaceted efforts encompass:</p>
<p>Habitat Restoration and Preservation: Prioritizing the identification and safeguarding of critical Woylie habitats, encompassing high-quality areas and key connectivity zones between disparate populations.</p>
<p>Mitigation of Introduced Predators: Implementing effective predator control measures, encompassing methods such as trapping, baiting, and strategic fencing, to curb the impact of invasive species like foxes and cats.</p>
<p>Disease Management Programs: Enacting proactive programs for disease management, including vaccination initiatives for Woylies and vigilant population monitoring to detect and respond to potential disease outbreaks.</p>
<p>Population Translocation: Fostering the relocation of Woylies to new areas to establish additional populations, a strategy designed to mitigate the risk of extinction arising from unforeseen events and enhance the overall resilience of the Woylie population.</p>
<p>These concerted conservation endeavors are instrumental in the ongoing protection and flourishing of Woylies within the Australian landscape.</p>
<p>Specific recommendations for effective conservation strategies encompass:</p>
<p>Identification and Protection of Vital Habitats: Precisely delineating and conserving critical Woylie habitats, encompassing areas of exceptional ecological value and connectivity corridors that link divergent Woylie communities.</p>
<p>Stringent Control of Invasive Predators: Vigilantly managing invasive predators such as foxes and cats through a multifaceted approach that includes trapping, baiting, and strategically designed protective enclosures.</p>
<p>Formulation and Execution of Robust Disease Management Regimens: Enacting comprehensive disease management programs inclusive of vaccination initiatives and vigilant surveillance to promptly address potential disease outbreaks.</p>
<p>Strategic Population Translocation: Strategic relocation of Woylies to new regions to establish fresh populations, thereby mitigating the vulnerability to extinction due to unpredictable events and reinforcing the overall resilience of the Woylie population.</p>
<p>These combined efforts represent a pivotal commitment to ensuring the enduring vitality of Woylies and their integral place within the Australian ecosystem.</p>

<p>The provided code filters the dataset to isolate Woylie sightings that occurred exclusively in the year 2022 and subsequently generates a bar chart to visualize the distribution of these sightings across different months.</p>
<p>The resulting bar chart shows that the number of Woylie sightings varied throughout the year, but the highest number of sightings occurred in the spring and summer months (October to March). The lowest number of sightings occurred in the winter months (April to September).</p>
<p>There are a few possible explanations for this pattern. One possibility is that Woylies are more active during the spring and summer months due to the warmer weather and longer days. Another possibility is that there is more food available for Woylies during the spring and summer months. Finally, it is also possible that Woylies are more visible during the spring and summer months because they are spending more time outside.</p>
<p>To delve into the connection between temperature and sightings, you have the option to craft scatter plots or line plots that unveil how temperature variables like ‘tmax’ or ‘tmin’ correlate with the observed number of sightings. Here’s an illustrative instance of crafting a plot:</p>

<p>The ensuing code constructs a scatter plot wherein ‘tmax’ is situated on the horizontal axis, while the number of sightings occupies the vertical axis. The resulting scatter plot shows a positive correlation between maximum temperature and the number of Woylie sightings. This suggests that Woylies are more likely to be seen on days where the maximum temperature is between 20 and 35.</p>

<p>The resulting scatter plot shows a negative correlation between minimum temperature and the number of Woylie sightings. This suggests that Woylies are less likely to be seen during periods when the minimum temperature is lower. However, when the minimum temperature is between about 5 and 20 woylies have been seen more often.</p>

<p>Lastly, the chart above displays the relationship between minimum temperature (tmin) and maximum temperature (tmax) in 2022. The blue line represents the line of best fit, indicating a moderate positive correlation between the two temperature variables.</p>
<p>The resulting scatter plot shows a positive correlation between minimum temperature and maximum temperature. This suggests that days with higher minimum temperatures tend to also have higher maximum temperatures.</p>
<p>Another way to interpret the scatter plot is that the points tend to cluster around the diagonal line. This suggests that the minimum temperature and maximum temperature are often close to each other.</p>

<h1 data-number="4"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Ecotourism</h1>
<p>Ecotourism involves traveling to places in support of the conservation efforts of endangered wildlife. To assess the level of interest in ecotourism for the Woylie, an analysis that combines tourism data and previous findings will provide us with a holistic view.</p>
<p>The tourism data will be obtained from <a href="https://www.tra.gov.au">Tourism Research Australia (TRA)</a> and will be used to analyse sightings close to the weather stations of interest, as reported in <a href="#sec-ref">Section&nbsp;2.1.0.1</a>. The focus will be on one of the prominent regions where the Woylie is found: the SA2 region of Narrabri Surrounds.</p>
<section id="analysis-of-tourists-in-narrabri-surrounds" class="level2" data-number="4.1">
<h2 data-number="4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analysis-of-tourists-in-narrabri-surrounds"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Analysis of tourists in Narrabri Surrounds</h2>
<p>The ‘tourism’ data will be filtered for the region of Narrabri Surrounds as part of the analysis. The purpose of tourism will also be filtered to holiday since this suggests the intention to travel for sightseeing and exploration. Other purposes, such as visiting friends and relatives or business, may include visiting the endangered Woylie species during the trip, but the purposes are too broad to draw conclusive insights. Therefore, choosing holiday tourism data will result in the most accurate analysis.</p>

</figure>
</div>
</div>
<p>Based on our initial analysis of <a href="#fig-narr">Figure&nbsp;1</a>, we can observe the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The number of trips designated as “holidays” are highly irregular with multiple quarters and years of no holiday visitors in the region of interest.</li>
<li>As a result, there is no discernible seasonality in the holiday visits in this region.</li>
<li>The highest number of holiday visitors were recorded in the 3rd quarter of 2009 with close to 4278 visits.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that we have looked into the number of visitors in the Mallee region for the purpose of holidays, it will be interesting to compare the sightings and understand if there is any correlation between the sightings and the presence of the number of visitors.</p>
<p>Let us now try to compare the Woylie sightings with the visitor trends for the Mallee region.</p>

<p>Based on the analysis of <a href="#fig-sighting">Figure&nbsp;2</a>, following are the key takeaways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>While the Narrabri region was observed to be the region with the highest Woylie sightings in Australia, this was not always the case.</li>
<li>Based on the sightings data from the Atlas of Living Australia, the sightings of Woylies in the Narrabri region were all in the 3rd and 4th quarters of the year 2022.</li>
<li>Upon observing this peculiar trend in the data, a deeper analysis was undertaken to get to the root cause for the skewed sightings.</li>
<li>Based on a detailed report by the <a href="https://www.australianwildlife.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Pilliga-Ecohealth-Report-2022-23.pdf">Australian wildlife organisation</a>, the Woylies due to <strong>being an endangered wild being</strong>, are inhabited within the <strong>safe confines of the Pilliga East Forest reserve, which is in the Narrabri SA2 region</strong>.</li>
<li>These Woylies were transferred from Western Australia to New South Wales (where Narrabri region is a part of) in large numbers in the year 2022 for the <strong>purpose of safekeeping and providing the right environment for them to breed.</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>special conservation efforts taken up by the Australian wildlife organisation</strong> as mentioned in the above points are expected to contribute to the <strong>high number of Woylie sightings in the year 2022</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>There is no clear year-by-year trend in tourism numbers. When grouping the tourism numbers by quarter, Quarter 1 experiences the fewest tourists compared to Quarter 3, which receives the most. Specifically, from January to March, Narrabri Surrounds experiences the least tourism, and from July to September, the area has the most tourism.</p>
<p>In terms of sightings of the Woylie specifically in the Narrabri region, these sightings occurred only in Quarters 3 and 4 of 2022. This suggests a recent surge in observations, but unfortunately, the tourism data for trips involving over a thousand people is only available for Quarter 3, 2022.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output-display">
<p><img src="report_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-39-1.png" class="img-fluid" width="672"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Overall, there is a limited correlation between these two sets of data. It is evident that tourism in the Narrabri Surrounds area exhibits significant inconsistency and year-to-year variation. The peak in Woylie observations in Narrabri Surrounds toward the end of 2022 can be attributed to conservation efforts for this endangered species, resulting in a notable increase in sightings. However, the lack of alignment between these two time periods hinders further analysis. This suggests that tourism in the area may not be strongly linked to Woylie sightings, ultimately yielding an inconclusive result in terms of ecotourism.</p>
<p>In general, an internet search for terms such as <em>“Pilliga Forest Conservation,”</em> <em>“Woylie,”</em> and <em>“Narrabri Surrounds Woylie,”</em> or a combination of these terms, yields minimal results related to marketing efforts promoting visits to the area for Woylie sightings.</p>
<p>This aligns with our findings, indicating that there is little to no ecotourism activity in this area for this particular species.</p>
