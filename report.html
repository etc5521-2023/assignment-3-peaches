<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>The Brush-Tailed Bettong or Woylie (Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi) is a remarkable Australian marsupial with unique characteristics. It thrives in a diverse range of habitats, including forests, woodlands, and shrublands, where dense vegetation offers shelter and sustenance. This nocturnal creature is most active during the night and rests in leafy grass nests during the day. Unfortunately, the Woylie has faced a perilous decline, with its population plummeting by more than 90% in the past two centuries. This decline can be attributed to various factors, including habitat loss, introduced predators, and disease. Consequently, the Woylie is currently classified as a critically endangered species, receiving protection from the Australian government. Most of the remaining Woylie population resides in wildlife sanctuaries, where they can live free from predators. While the Woylie is not a common attraction for tourists due to its elusive nature, there are a few places like the Perth Zoo and the Australian Wildlife Conservancy’s Scotia Sanctuary where visitors can catch a glimpse of this unique marsupial.</p>
<p>From this data we expect the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li>“We expect to observe a decline in Woylie occurrences over the past 20 years, reflecting their critically endangered status.”</li>
<li>“The dataset is likely to show fewer sightings in the wild over recent years, given that Woylies are mostly found in protected sanctuaries.”</li>
<li>“Woylies are expected to have limited sightings near weather stations, as their habitat preferences are specific to certain regions within Australia.”</li>
<li>“We anticipate a seasonal pattern in sightings, with more occurrences during specific times of the year, possibly correlating with breeding seasons or favorable climate conditions.”</li>
<li>“It is unlikely that there will be a significant number of sightings in urban areas, as Woylies tend to avoid human-populated regions due to habitat disturbance.”</li>
</ul>

<p>To ensure a robust foundation for the analysis, occurrence records of the Brush-Tailed Bettong or Woylie (Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi) were obtained from the <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/">Atlas of Living Australia (ALA)</a> database using the functions of the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/galah/index.html">galah</a> R package.</p>
<p>This dataset includes essential information, such as date, time, and collector identification details, and comprises 13 variables and 2,276 observations across Australia as of the current report.</p>
<p>The code to derive the species data can be viewed below and the data dictionary of the variables can be seen in <a href="#fig-data">Figure&nbsp;1</a>.</p>

<p>Exploring the correlation between weather conditions and Woylie sightings can yield valuable insights into their behavior. To conduct this analysis, it would be useful to first identify the locations where Woylies are most frequently found and then obtain the weather data from the nearest weather stations.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/global-historical-climatology-network-daily">Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN)</a> database contains weather station data that are valuable for analysing trends in weather patterns and precipitation. This data can be obtained using the <code>rnoaa</code> package.</p>

<p>As demonstrated in <a href="#fig-cluster-map">Figure&nbsp;4</a>, the five closest weather stations are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Weather Station ID: ASN00020028, which is closest to the Danggali Wilderness Protection area.</p></li>
<li><p>Weather Station ID: ASN00023373, which is closest to the Yookamura Private Nature Reserve.</p></li>
<li><p>Weather Station ID: ASN00018192, which is closest to the sightings near Port Lincoln at the Lincoln National Park.</p></li>
<li><p>Weather Station ID: ASN00076031, which is closest to the sightings at Mallee Cliffs National Park.</p></li>
<li><p>Weather Station ID: ASN00054038, located near the sightings at Pilliga East State Forest.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The highest number of Woylie sightings was recorded in Pilliga East State Forest, and as a result, the weather data to be obtained will be from the nearest weather station, which is the Narrabri Airport weather station.</p>

<p>In this section, we will delve into the exploratory data analysis of Woylie sightings, focusing on verifying our expectations through data visualization and analysis. Furthermore, we will evaluate whether visual inference techniques support or contradict our initial assumptions.</p>
<p>Now, let’s move forward with exploring the data visually to acquire meaningful insights into the behavior and distribution of the Woylie.</p>

</figure>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Leaflet map shown in <a href="#sec-ref">Section&nbsp;3.2</a> and provided here again in <a href="#fig-cluster-map-2">Figure&nbsp;5</a> has already given us a geographical representation of Woylie sightings.</p>
<p>Woylies exhibit habitat preferences specific to certain regions within Australia, and these preferences are linked to five particular weather stations: Gluepot Reserve, Nuriootpa Viticultural, North Shields (Port Lincoln Airport), Mildura Airport, and Narrabri Airport, respectively. These weather stations are associated with the following National Parks: Danggali Wilderness Protection area, Yookamura Private Nature Reserve, Lincoln National Park, Mallee Cliffs National Park, and Pilliga East State Forest.</p>
<p>The significant reduction in Woylie numbers, resulting from challenges related to habitat loss and disease, is apparent on the map. The strategy of population relocation, designed to facilitate the movement of Woylies to conservation areas, is evident in the fact that the majority of Woylie clusters are now located in National Parks. The implementation of disease management programs is also substantiated by evidence in <a href="#sec-ref-3">Section&nbsp;4.1.1</a>, which revealed a recent increase in Woylie sightings in recent years, primarily because they are more readily available for observation in National Parks.</p>

<p>The observed seasonal pattern in Woylie sightings reveals a distinct trend characterised by an increase in sightings during the Spring and Summer months, followed by a decline in the Autumn and Winter months. This intriguing pattern can be attributed to several underlying factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Abundance of Food: Woylies primarily subsist on a diet of insects and seeds. The surge in sightings during the warmer seasons correlates with heightened food availability, as both plants and insects flourish during this time.</p></li>
<li><p>Breeding Season: Woylies engage in breeding activities during the Spring and Summer, with newborn pups typically making their debut in late Summer and early Autumn. During this period, the increased sightings may be a consequence of heightened activity as Woylies nurture their offspring.</p></li>
<li><p>Weather Influences: Woylies exhibit adaptations to warmer and drier environmental conditions. Consequently, they may reduce their activity levels during the cooler and wetter Autumn and Winter months, leading to fewer recorded sightings.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, the observed seasonal pattern in Woylie sightings shows how the species adapts to varying environmental conditions throughout the year.</p>

<p>The provided code filters the dataset to isolate Woylie sightings that occurred exclusively in the year 2022 and subsequently generates a bar chart to visualize the distribution of these sightings across different months.</p>
<p>The resulting bar chart shows that the number of Woylie sightings varied throughout the year, but the highest number of sightings occurred in the spring and summer months (October to March). The lowest number of sightings occurred in the winter months (April to September).</p>
<p>There are a few possible explanations for this pattern. One possibility is that Woylies are more active during the spring and summer months due to the warmer weather and longer days. Another possibility is that there is more food available for Woylies during the spring and summer months. Finally, it is also possible that Woylies are more visible during the spring and summer months because they are spending more time outside.</p>
<p>To delve into the connection between temperature and sightings, you have the option to craft scatter plots or line plots that unveil how temperature variables like ‘tmax’ or ‘tmin’ correlate with the observed number of sightings. Here’s an illustrative instance of crafting a plot:</p>

<p>Upon analysing the maximum and minimum temperatures on the days of Woylie sightings as illustrated by <a href="#fig-temp">Figure&nbsp;6</a>, we can obseve the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There appears to be lower number of Woylie sightings during the initial months of the year. The initial months in Australia constitute of the summer and is typically characterised by higher than average maximum and minimum temperatures. The low sightings during the summer suggests that the Woylies are not as active on warmer days.</p></li>
<li><p>Between the months of April to August, the number of Woylie sightings are observed to gradually rise. These months are relatively cold in Australia and appear to promote higher mobility among the Woylies.</p></li>
<li><p>There are distinctly higher number of observations from the month of September to December. This coincides with the Australian spring season. Based on the data, we can infer that the spring season appears to be the one promoting the highest activity among the Woylies.</p></li>

<p>Ecotourism involves traveling to places in support of the conservation efforts of endangered wildlife. To assess the level of interest in ecotourism for the Woylie, an analysis that combines tourism data from <a href="https://www.tra.gov.au">Tourism Research Australia (TRA)</a> and Woylie sightings near the weather station of interest, Narrabri Airport, as reported in <a href="#sec-ref">Section&nbsp;3.2</a>, will provide us with a holistic view. To ensure a more accurate matching of the data with tourism data, the observations of the Woylie are subsetted to focus on the Australian Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) region: Narrabri Surrounds.</p>

<p>The tourism data will be filtered for the region of Narrabri Surrounds as part of the analysis. The purpose of tourism trips will also be filtered to holiday trips since this suggests the intention to travel for sightseeing and exploration. Other purposes, such as visiting friends and relatives or business, may include visiting the endangered Woylie species during the trip, but the purposes are too broad to draw conclusive insights.

</figure>

</div>
<p>Based on the initial analysis of <a href="#fig-narr">Figure&nbsp;7</a>, the following observations can be made:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The number of trips designated as “holiday” is highly irregular, with multiple quarters and years showing no holiday visitors in the region of interest.</li>
<li>Consequently, there is no discernible seasonality in the holiday visits in this region.</li>
<li>The highest number of holiday visitors was recorded in the 3rd quarter of 2001, with nearly 13,445 visits.</li>
</ol>

<p>Similarly to <a href="#fig-narr">Figure&nbsp;7</a>, holiday tourism can be presented in a year calendar format to visualise and observe the annual tourism trend. The same irregular pattern with no clear year-by-year trend in tourism numbers can also be seen in <a href="#fig-holiday-year">Figure&nbsp;8</a>.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Based on the analysis of <a href="#fig-sighting">Figure&nbsp;10</a>, the following key observations can be made:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>While the Narrabri region was found to have the highest Woylie sightings in Australia, this was not always the case.</li>
<li>According to the sightings data from the Atlas of Living Australia, Woylie sightings in the Narrabri region were exclusively in the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2022.</li>
<li>Recognising this unique trend in the data, a more in-depth analysis was conducted to identify the underlying cause of this skewed pattern.</li>
<li>According to a detailed report by the <a href="https://www.australianwildlife.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Pilliga-Ecohealth-Report-2022-23.pdf">Australian wildlife organisation</a>, Woylies, <strong>being an endangered species</strong>, are now inhabiting the <strong>protected Pilliga East Forest reserve, located in the Narrabri SA2 region.</strong></li>
<li>A significant number of Woylies were transferred from Western Australia to New South Wales (including the Narrabri region) in 2022, with the <strong>purpose of providing a safe environment for breeding and conservation efforts.</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>special conservation initiatives undertaken by the Australian wildlife organisation,</strong> as mentioned in the points above, are expected to contribute to the <strong>high number of Woylie sightings in the year 2022.</strong></li>

Conclusion of Ecotourism in Narrabri Surrounds
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Overall, there is a limited relation between these two sets of data. It is evident that tourism in the Narrabri Surrounds area exhibits significant inconsistency and year-to-year variation. The peak in Woylie observations in Narrabri Surrounds toward the end of 2022 can be attributed to conservation efforts for this endangered species, resulting in a notable increase in sightings. However, the lack of alignment between these two time periods hinders further analysis. This suggests that tourism in the area may not be strongly linked to Woylie sightings, ultimately yielding an inconclusive result in terms of ecotourism.</p>
<p>In general, an internet search for terms such as <em>“Pilliga State Conservation Area,”</em> <em>“Pilliga National Park”,</em> <em>“Woylie,”</em> and <em>“Narrabri Surrounds,”</em> or a combination of these terms, yields minimal results related to marketing efforts promoting visits to the area for Woylie sightings.</p>
<p>This aligns with our findings, indicating that there is little to no ecotourism activity in this area for this particular species.</p>

<li><p>There appears to be an increasing trend in the number of trips from 1998 until around 2021-2022. The darker shades in more recent years, especially around 2021-2022, indicate more trips compared to the lighter shades in earlier years.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Q1</strong>: The trips in Q1 seems Q1 has demonstrated fluctuations over the years, starting with low activity in the late 1990s to early 2000s, experiencing a rise in the mid 2000s, stabilizing in the late 2000s to early 2010s, and then witnessing another increase in the recent years, notably 2022.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Q2</strong> : This quarter appears to have moderate activity over the years</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Q3</strong> : The consistent dark shades for Q3 indicate a substantial number of trips, especially in the recent years from 2016 onwards.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Q4</strong> : Activity in Q4 is on the lower side, with lighter shades indicating fewer trips.</p></li>
