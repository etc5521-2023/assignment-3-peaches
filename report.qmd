The Brush-Tailed Bettong or Woylie (Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi) is a
remarkable Australian marsupial with unique characteristics. It thrives
in a diverse range of habitats, including forests, woodlands, and
shrublands, where dense vegetation offers shelter and sustenance. This
nocturnal creature is most active during the night and rests in leafy
grass nests during the day. Unfortunately, the Woylie has faced a
perilous decline, with its population plummeting by more than 90% in the
past two centuries. This decline can be attributed to various factors,
including habitat loss, introduced predators, and disease. Consequently,
the Woylie is currently classified as a critically endangered species,
receiving protection from the Australian government. Most of the
remaining Woylie population resides in wildlife sanctuaries, where they
can live free from predators. While the Woylie is not a common
attraction for tourists due to its elusive nature, there are a few
places like the Perth Zoo and the Australian Wildlife Conservancy's
Scotia Sanctuary where visitors can catch a glimpse of this unique
marsupial.

![The brush-tailed Bettong or Woylie (Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi)](woylie.png){#fig-woyliepic}

From this data we expect the following results:

-   "We expect to observe a decline in Woylie occurrences over the past
    20 years, reflecting their critically endangered status."
-   "The dataset is likely to show fewer sightings in the wild over
    recent years, given that Woylies are mostly found in protected
    sanctuaries."
-   "Woylies are expected to have limited sightings near weather
    stations, as their habitat preferences are specific to certain
    regions within Australia."
-   "We anticipate a seasonal pattern in sightings, with more
    occurrences during specific times of the year, possibly correlating
    with breeding seasons or favorable climate conditions."
-   "It is unlikely that there will be a significant number of sightings
    in urban areas, as Woylies tend to avoid human-populated regions due
    to habitat disturbance."

# Data description
## Species data

To ensure a robust foundation for the analysis, occurrence records of the Brush-Tailed Bettong or Woylie (Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi) were obtained from the [Atlas of Living Australia (ALA)](https://www.ala.org.au/) database using the functions of the [galah](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/galah/index.html) R package. 

This dataset includes essential information, such as date, time, and collector identification details, and comprises 13 variables and 2,276 observations across Australia as of the current report.

The code to derive the species data can be viewed below and the data dictionary of the variables can be seen in @fig-data.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# load occurence records for woylie from ALA
galah_config(email = "aran0026@student.monash.edu")
woylie <-
  galah_call() %>%
  galah_identify("Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi") %>%
  galah_select(group = c("basic", "event")) %>% 
  atlas_occurrences()

# save data as a csv in data-raw folder
write.csv(woylie, file = "data-raw/woylie.csv")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
# load data back into R environment
woylie <- read_csv("data-raw/woylie.csv") %>%

    )
  )

variables %>%
  kableExtra::kbl(caption = "Data Dictionary for the Woylie dataset") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered")
```

## Tourism data

In addition, to conduct an analysis on ecotourism of the Woylie, tourism data from [Tourism Research Australia (TRA)](https://www.tra.gov.au) was obtained. 

This dataset includes spatial, temporal, and trip information. It comprises 4 variables and 1,228,000 observations covering Quarter 1 of 1998 to Quarter 4 of 2022 across all Australian Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) regions of Australia.

The data dictionary of the variables can be seen in @fig-data-tourism.

```{r echo=FALSE}
#| label: fig-data-tourism
#| fig-cap: "Variable definitions for the Tourism dataset"

variables2 <-
  data.frame(
    Variable = c(
      "Quarter",
      "Region",
      "Purpose",
      "Trips"
    ),
    Explained = c(
      "The year and quarter of the observation in the format YYYY Q, e.g., Q1, Q2, Q3, or Q4.",
      "The Australian Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) region of the observation.",
      "The purpose of the trip, categorised as Holiday, Visiting friends and relatives, Business, or Other reason.",
      "The total number of trips in thousands ('000)."
    )
  )


variables2 %>%
  kableExtra::kbl(caption = "Data Dictionary for the Tourism dataset") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered")
```

# Initial data analysis

## Species data

In preparation for the forthcoming analysis, an Initial Data Analysis (IDA) was conducted on the species data. This involved removing a few unnecessary columns and systematically saving only the wild sightings, as the analysis focuses on the natural wild habitat and behavior of the species.

```{r}
# filter wild sightings
WILD_THING_woylie <- woylie %>%
  select(-c(eventRemarks, eventID)) %>%
  filter(
    samplingProtocol %in% c(
      "Camera Trapping",
      "Transect Spotlighting",
      "Sign-diggings",
      "Observed-spotlighting",
      "Sign-dropping"
    )
  )

save(WILD_THING_woylie, file = "data/WILD_THING_woylie.rda")
```

After reducing the dataset, variable types and missing values were checked, as depicted in Figure @fig-vis-dat. There were no missing values that were significantly of interest or required cleaning.

```{r}
#| label: fig-vis-dat
#| fig-cap: "Visualising the data set using the `visdat` function."

# view missing variables and variable types
visdat::vis_dat(WILD_THING_woylie)
```

## Weather data {#sec-ref}

Exploring the correlation between weather conditions and Woylie sightings can yield valuable insights into their behavior. To conduct this analysis, it would be useful to first identify the locations where Woylies are most frequently found and then obtain the weather data from the nearest weather stations.

The [Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/global-historical-climatology-network-daily) database contains weather station data that are valuable for analysing trends in weather patterns and precipitation. This data can be obtained using the `rnoaa` package.

```{r}
# downloading the coordinates of Australian weather stations
aus_stations <- ghcnd_stations() |>
  filter(str_starts(id, "ASN")) |>
  filter(last_year >= 2020) |>
  mutate(wmo_id = as.numeric(wmo_id),
         name = str_to_lower(name)) |>
  select(-state,-gsn_flag) |>
  filter(element %in% c("PRCP", "TMAX", "TMIN")) |>
  nest(element:last_year) |>
  rowwise() |>
  filter(nrow(data) == 3) |>
  select(-data) 
```

Utilising an interactive Leaflet map of Woylie sightings allows for the identification of the nearest weather stations to the clusters of Woylie sightings. 

```{r}
#| label: fig-cluster-map
#| fig-cap: "The five highest clusters of Woylie sightings."

# k-means clustering
set.seed(383724)

coords_matrix <- WILD_THING_woylie %>%
  select(decimalLongitude, decimalLatitude) %>%
  as.matrix()

num_clusters <- 5  # number of clusters
kmeans_result <- kmeans(coords_matrix, centers = num_clusters)

# extract clusters
WILD_THING_woylie$cluster <- kmeans_result$cluster

# number of sightings in each cluster
cluster_counts <- WILD_THING_woylie %>%
  group_by(cluster) %>%
  summarise(num_sightings = n())

max_count <- max(cluster_counts$num_sightings)
normalized_counts <- cluster_counts$num_sightings / max_count
scaled_radius <- normalized_counts * 20  

# add circle markers for each sighting
map_clusters <- leaflet(data = WILD_THING_woylie) %>%
  addTiles() 

map_clusters <- map_clusters %>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    lng = ~decimalLongitude, 
    lat = ~decimalLatitude,    
    popup = ~paste("Sighting Date: ", format(eventDate, "%Y-%m-%d")),  # Popup text
    radius = ~scaled_radius[cluster],  #scaled radius based on the cluster
    color = "#C94A53",  
    fillOpacity = 0.7  
  )

# view the map of clusters
map_clusters
```

As demonstrated in @fig-cluster-map, the five closest weather stations are:

1.  Weather Station ID: ASN00020028, which is closest to the Danggali
    Wilderness Protection area.

2.  Weather Station ID: ASN00023373, which is closest to the Yookamura
    Private Nature Reserve.

3.  Weather Station ID: ASN00018192, which is closest to the sightings
    near Port Lincoln at the Lincoln National Park.

4.  Weather Station ID: ASN00076031, which is closest to the sightings
    at Mallee Cliffs National Park.

5.  Weather Station ID: ASN00054038, located near the sightings at
    Pilliga East State Forest.
    
The highest number of Woylie sightings was recorded in Pilliga East State Forest, and as a result, the weather data to be obtained will be from the nearest weather station, which is the Narrabri Airport weather station.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# filter weather station
narrabri <- aus_stations |>
  filter(id %in% "ASN00054038") |>
  rowwise() |>
  mutate(ts = list(
    meteo_pull_monitors(
      monitors = id,
      var = c("PRCP", "TMAX", "TMIN"),
      date_min = "2004-01-01",
      date_max = "2023-09-13"
    ) |>
      select(-id)
  )) |>
  rename(lat = latitude, long = longitude, elev = elevation) |> select(id, long, lat, elev, name, wmo_id, ts) %>%
  unnest(ts) |>
  mutate(tmax = tmax / 10, tmin = tmin / 10)
```

This weather data can then be merged with Woylie observation data to create a comprehensive dataset for use in @sec-ref-1.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# rename eventDate as date for convenience
WILD_THING_woylie <- WILD_THING_woylie %>%
  rename(date = eventDate)

# classifying the date columns as Date
WILD_THING_woylie$date <-
  as.Date(WILD_THING_woylie$date, origin = "1970-01-01")
narrabri$date <- 
  as.Date(narrabri$date, origin = "1970-01-01")

# filter observations in cluster 1 as it is the largest
woylie_most <- WILD_THING_woylie %>% 
  filter(cluster == 1)

# join the data sets by date
woylie_stations <- narrabri %>%
  left_join(woylie_most, by = "date")

# tidy data further
woylie_stations <- woylie_stations %>%
  
  # remove observations based on duplicate record IDs
  filter(!duplicated(recordID) | is.na(recordID)) %>%
  
  # create the sightings column
  mutate(sightings = ifelse(is.na(scientificName), 0, 1))

# save this as an rda file
save(woylie_stations, file = "data/woylie_stations.rda")
```

# Exploratory data analysis 

## Exploration of Woylie Sightings against intial expectations

```{r}
# load the wild sightings data back in
load(file = "data/WILD_THING_woylie.rda")
```

In this section, we will delve into the exploratory data analysis of
Woylie sightings, focusing on verifying our expectations through data
visualization and analysis. Furthermore, we will evaluate whether visual
inference techniques support or contradict our initial assumptions.

Now, let's move forward with exploring the data visually to acquire
meaningful insights into the behavior and distribution of the Woylie.

### Expectation 1: Trend in Woylie Sightings {#sec-ref-3}

```{r}
# Code for time series plot
ggplot(WILD_THING_woylie, aes(x = eventDate)) +
  geom_line(stat="count") +  # Count the number of sightings per date
  labs(title = "Trend in Woylie Sightings Over Time",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Number of Sightings") +
  theme_minimal()

```

-   This plot will observe the trend in Woylie sightings over the years.
-   This helps us assess whether the population is declining as
    expected.

### Expectation 2: Seasonal Pattern in Sightings

-   We will generate the following chart to visualize the seasonal
    pattern chart to investigate whether there are particular periods
    during the year when Woylie sightings are more frequent.
-   This analysis will assist us in determining if these sightings
    coincide with breeding seasons or specific climate conditions. Below
    is the code for generating the seasonal pattern chart.

```{r}
# Extract the month from the eventDate column
WILD_THING_woylie$month <- lubridate::month(WILD_THING_woylie$eventDate)

# Create a bar plot of monthly sightings
ggplot(WILD_THING_woylie, aes(x = month)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count") +
  labs(title = "Monthly Seasonal Pattern in Woylie Sightings",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Number of Sightings") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12, labels = month.abb) +  # Label months with abbreviations
  theme_minimal()

```

### Expectation 3: Geographical Distribution {#sec-ref-2}

```{r}
#| label: fig-cluster-map-2
#| fig-cap: "The five highest clusters of Woylie sightings."

map_clusters
```

The Leaflet map, initially featured in @sec-ref and presented again in @fig-cluster-map-2, provides a clear geographic representation of Woylie sightings.

Woylies exhibit distinct habitat preferences across various regions in Australia, and these preferences are closely associated with five specific weather stations: Gluepot Reserve, Nuriootpa Viticultural, North Shields (Port Lincoln Airport), Mildura Airport, and Narrabri Airport. These weather stations correspond to the following National Parks: Danggali Wilderness Protection area, Yookamura Private Nature Reserve, Lincoln National Park, Mallee Cliffs National Park, and Pilliga East State Forest.

The map starkly highlights the significant reduction in Woylie populations, stemming from challenges related to habitat loss and disease. Notably, it demonstrates the success of the population relocation strategy, which aims to guide Woylies towards conservation areas. The majority of Woylie clusters are now concentrated within the National Parks, as shown on the map.

Moreover, the implementation of disease management programs is supported by evidence in @sec-ref-3, which indicates a recent upsurge in Woylie sightings in recent years. This increase can be attributed to the fact that these creatures are more readily observed within National Parks, further underscoring the effectiveness of this conservation approach.

### Theoretical Justification for Expectation 2

The observed seasonal pattern in Woylie sightings reveals a distinct trend characterised by an increase in sightings during the Spring and Summer months, followed by a decline in the Autumn and Winter months. This intriguing pattern can be attributed to several underlying factors:

- Abundance of Food: Woylies primarily subsist on a diet of insects and seeds. The surge in sightings during the warmer seasons correlates with heightened food availability, as both plants and insects flourish during this time.

- Breeding Season: Woylies engage in breeding activities during the Spring and Summer, with newborn pups typically making their debut in late Summer and early Autumn. During this period, the increased sightings may be a consequence of heightened activity as Woylies nurture their offspring.

- Weather Influences: Woylies exhibit adaptations to warmer and drier environmental conditions. Consequently, they may reduce their activity levels during the cooler and wetter Autumn and Winter months, leading to fewer recorded sightings.

In essence, the observed seasonal pattern in Woylie sightings shows how the species adapts to varying environmental conditions throughout the year.



## Exploration of Woylie Sightings with Weather Data {#sec-ref-1}

```{r}
# load the woylie stations file back in
load(file = "data/woylie_stations.rda")
```


```{r}
#Plot a bar chart to see the sightings each year
ggplot(woylie_stations, aes(x = date)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Woylie Sightings over time")
```

Since, it appears there is a spike in sightings between 2021 and 2023. We will check the years where sightings occur. 

```{r}
#check years that sightings actually occur
#create a column for years

woylie_stations$year <- lubridate::year(woylie_stations$date)

woylie_stations%>% filter(sightings == 1)%>%distinct(year)
  
  
```

2022 is the only year that woylie sightings have been recorded. Therefore, the following visualizations will contain only information from 2022 as the other years are irrelevant in this respect.

```{r}
# Filtering  the data for sightings in 2022
woylie_sightings_2022 <- woylie_stations %>%
  filter(year(date) == 2022)

#Extracting the month name
woylie_sightings_2022$month_name <- 
  factor(format(as.Date(woylie_sightings_2022$date), "%B"), levels = month.name)

# A bar chart to visualize the number of sightings in 2022
ggplot(woylie_sightings_2022, aes(x = month_name)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Woylie Sightings in 2022",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Number of Sightings")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 25, hjust = 1))

```

The provided code filters the dataset to isolate Woylie sightings that occurred exclusively in the year 2022 and subsequently generates a bar chart to visualize the distribution of these sightings across different months.

The resulting bar chart shows that the number of Woylie sightings varied throughout the year, but the highest number of sightings occurred in the spring and summer months (October to March). The lowest number of sightings occurred in the winter months (April to September).

There are a few possible explanations for this pattern. One possibility is that Woylies are more active during the spring and summer months due to the warmer weather and longer days. Another possibility is that there is more food available for Woylies during the spring and summer months. Finally, it is also possible that Woylies are more visible during the spring and summer months because they are spending more time outside.

To delve into the connection between temperature and sightings, you have the option to craft scatter plots or line plots that unveil how temperature variables like 'tmax' or 'tmin' correlate with the observed number of sightings. Here's an illustrative instance of crafting a plot:

```{r}
#A scatter plot to visualize the relationship between tmax and sightings
woylie_sightings_2022<-
  woylie_sightings_2022 %>% 
  group_by(month_name) %>%
  mutate(count_sightings=n())

```


```{r warning=FALSE}
#| label: fig-temp
#| fig-cap: "Temperature range on the days of Woylie sightings for each month of the year"

woylie_sightings_2022$observation <- 1:nrow(woylie_sightings_2022)
woylie_sightings_2022$observation <- factor(woylie_sightings_2022$observation)
pl_temp <- ggplot(woylie_sightings_2022, aes(y = observation)) +
  geom_dumbbell(aes(x = tmin, xend = tmax),
                color = "darkgray",
                size = 1, dot_guide = FALSE, 
                size_x = 3,  size_xend = 3,
                colour_xend = "#F69541", colour_x = "#699DC6")  + theme_classic()
   
pl_temp + geom_vline(xintercept = mean(woylie_sightings_2022$tmax,na.rm = TRUE),alpha = 0.5,linetype =2,color = 'red') +  
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(woylie_sightings_2022$tmin,na.rm = TRUE),alpha = 0.5,linetype =2,color = 'blue') +
    scale_linetype_manual(values = "Mean Temperature", name = "Line Type") +
 facet_wrap(~month(date,label = TRUE),scales = "free_y") + theme(axis.text.y = element_blank()) + 
  labs(x = "Temperature (in degree celsius)",y= "Unique Woylie sighting") +
  ggtitle("Temperature range on days of Woylie sightings for different months of the year")
  

```

:::{.callout-note}
# Key takeaway

Upon analysing the maximum and minimum temperatures on the days of Woylie sightings as illustrated by @fig-temp, we can obseve the following:

1. There appears to be lower number of Woylie sightings during the initial months of the year. The initial months in Australia constitute of the summer and is typically characterised by higher than average maximum and minimum temperatures. The low sightings during the summer suggests that the Woylies are not as active on warmer days.

2. Between the months of April to August, the number of Woylie sightings are observed to gradually rise. These months are relatively cold in Australia and appear to promote higher mobility among the Woylies.


3. There are distinctly higher number of observations from the month of September to December. This coincides with the Australian spring season. Based on the data, we can infer that the spring season appears to be the one promoting the highest activity among the Woylies.

# Temporal analysis




# Ecotourism

Ecotourism involves traveling to places in support of the conservation efforts of endangered wildlife. To assess the level of interest in ecotourism for the Woylie, an analysis that combines tourism data from [Tourism Research Australia (TRA)](https://www.tra.gov.au) and Woylie sightings near the weather station of interest, Narrabri Airport, as reported in @sec-ref, will provide us with a holistic view. To ensure a more accurate matching of the data with tourism data, the observations of the Woylie are subsetted to focus on the Australian Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) region: Narrabri Surrounds.

## Narrabri Surrounds 

The tourism data will be filtered for the region of Narrabri Surrounds as part of the analysis. The purpose of tourism trips will also be filtered to holiday trips since this suggests the intention to travel for sightseeing and exploration. Other purposes, such as visiting friends and relatives or business, may include visiting the endangered Woylie species during the trip, but the purposes are too broad to draw conclusive insights. Therefore, choosing holiday tourism data will result in the most accurate analysis.

```{r}
load("data/woylie_region.rda")

tourism_woylie <- tourism %>%
  filter(Purpose == "Holiday")

tourism_pl <- tourism_woylie %>%
  filter(Region == "Narrabri Surrounds")

tourism_pl_grouped <- tourism_pl %>%
  group_by_key() %>%
  index_by() %>%
  summarise(Total_trips = round(sum(Trips * 1000)))
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-narr
#| fig-cap: "Total Holiday Trips in Narrabri Surrounds"

pl1 <-
  ggplot(data = tourism_pl_grouped, aes(x = Quarter, y = Total_trips)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic() +
  ggtitle("Tourism Trends in Narrabri Surrounds") +
  labs(
    x = "Year (Quarter)",
    y = "Total holiday trips",
    caption = "Source: Tourism Research Australia",
    subtitle = "1998 Q1 - 2022 Q4"
  )
ggplotly(pl1)
```

Based on the initial analysis of @fig-narr, the following observations can be made:

1. The number of trips designated as "holiday" is highly irregular, with multiple quarters and years showing no holiday visitors in the region of interest.
2. Consequently, there is no discernible seasonality in the holiday visits in this region.
3. The highest number of holiday visitors was recorded in the 3rd quarter of 2001, with nearly 13,445 visits.

```{r echo=FALSE}
narrabri_surrounds_tourism <- tourism_pl %>%
  mutate(Year = year(Quarter),
         Q = quarter(Quarter),
         Quarter = tsibble::yearquarter(Quarter))
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-holiday-year
#| fig-cap: "Holiday Tourism in Narrabri Surrounds by Year (1998 - 2022)"

ggplot(narrabri_surrounds_tourism,
       aes(x = Quarter, y = Trips, fill = as.factor(Q))) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap( ~ Year, scales = "free_x") +
  labs(title = "Holiday Tourism in Narrabri Surrounds by Year",
       x = "",
       y = "Number of trips ('000)") +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Quarterly Period")) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank())
```

Similarly to @fig-narr, @fig-holiday-year presents holiday tourism in a year calendar format to visualise and observe the annual tourism trend. The data reveals a similar irregular pattern with no clear year-by-year trend in tourism numbers.

```{r}
#| label: fig-holiday-group
#| fig-cap: "Total Holiday Tourism in Narrabri Surrounds by Quarter (1998 - 2022)"

narrabri_surrounds_tourism %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Q, y = Trips, fill = as.factor(Q))) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(
    title = "Total Holiday Tourism in Narrabri Surrounds by Quarter",
    subtitle = "Years 1998 - 2022",
    x = "Quarter",
    y = "Number of trips ('000)"
  ) +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") +

When grouping the tourism visit numbers in Narrabri Surrounds by quarter, Quarter 1 experiences the fewest tourists compared to Quarter 3, which receives the most, as can be seen in @fig-holiday-group. Specifically, from January to March, Narrabri Surrounds sees the least tourism, while from July to September, the area has the most tourism.

## Species Sightings

The examination of the number of visitors in the Narrabri Surrounds region for holiday purposes has now laid the foundation for an exploration of wildlife sightings and visitation trends, allowing for the investigation of potential correlations.

Below, an analysis of Woylie sightings with visitor trends in the Narrabri Surrounds region is conducted.

```{r include=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
t_region <- st_read(here::here("data/SA2_2021_AUST_SHP_GDA2020/SA2_2021_AUST_GDA2020.shp")) |>
  ms_simplify(keep = 0.1) |>
  st_transform(crs = st_crs("WGS84")) |>
  st_make_valid() |>
  select(STE_NAME21, SA2_NAME21, SA2_CODE21, geometry) |>
  rename("state" = STE_NAME21,
         "region" = SA2_NAME21,
         "sa2_code21" = SA2_CODE21)


woylie_sf <- WILD_THING_woylie |>
  filter(!is.na(decimalLongitude) & !is.na(decimalLatitude)) |>
  select(-c(dataResourceName , recordID,scientificName,taxonConceptID)) |>
  st_as_sf(coords = c("decimalLongitude", "decimalLatitude"),
  crs = st_crs("WGS84"))


woylie_stsf <-
  st_join(t_region, woylie_sf, left = TRUE) %>%  
  filter(!is.na(region))

woylie_narrabri <- woylie_stsf %>% filter(region == "Narrabri Surrounds")
woylie_narrabri_grouped <- woylie_narrabri %>% group_by(eventDate) %>% summarise(Total_sightings = n() )
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-woylie-obs
#| fig-cap: "Trend line graph of Woylie Sightings in Narrabri Surrounds (September - December 2022)"

q_colours <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(12, "Set3")[3:4]

woylie_tsibble <- woylie_narrabri_grouped %>%
  as_tsibble(key = Total_sightings, index = eventDate)

woylie_tsibble %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = as.Date(eventDate), y = Total_sightings)) +
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = as.Date("2022-09-06"), xmax = as.Date("2022-10-01"), ymin = 0, ymax = +Inf, fill = "Quarter 3")) +
 # geom_rect(aes(xmin = as.Date("2022-10-01"), xmax = as.Date("2023-01-01"), ymin = 0, ymax = 1, fill = "4")) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Quarter 3" = q_colours[1], "4" = q_colours[2])) +
  labs(
    title = "Woylie Observations in Narrabri Surrounds",
    subtitle = "September - December 2022",
    x = "Date of Sighting",
    y = "Number of Sightings"
  ) +
  theme_classic() +
  geom_label(aes(x = as.Date("2022-09-19"), y = 3, label = "~6,522 tourist"), color = "#800080", size = 3)+
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Tourism"))
```

@fig-woylie-obs displays the sightings that occurred in Quarters 3 and 4 of 2022. This recent, short surge in observations is too brief to correspond with the tourism data. This is evident from the highlighted quarter. It was the only quarter where trips involving over a thousand people occurred, which is also noticeable in the last calendar plot in @fig-holiday-year.

:::{.callout-note}
# Key takeaways

Based on the analysis of @fig-woylie-obs, the following key observations can be made:

1. While the Narrabri region was found to have the highest Woylie sightings in Australia, this was not always the case.
2. According to the sightings data from the Atlas of Living Australia, Woylie sightings in the Narrabri region were exclusively in the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2022.
3. Recognising this unique trend in the data, a more in-depth analysis was conducted to identify the underlying cause of this skewed pattern.
4. According to a detailed report by the [Australian wildlife organisation](https://www.australianwildlife.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Pilliga-Ecohealth-Report-2022-23.pdf), Woylies, __being an endangered species__, are now inhabiting the __protected Pilliga East Forest reserve, located in the Narrabri SA2 region.__
5. A significant number of Woylies were transferred from Western Australia to New South Wales (including the Narrabri region) in 2022, with the __purpose of providing a safe environment for breeding and conservation efforts.__
6. The __special conservation initiatives undertaken by the Australian wildlife organisation,__ as mentioned in the points above, are expected to contribute to the __high number of Woylie sightings in the year 2022.__

:::

Overall, there is a limited relation between these two sets of data. It is evident that tourism in the Narrabri Surrounds area exhibits significant inconsistency and year-to-year variation. The peak in Woylie observations in Narrabri Surrounds toward the end of 2022 can be attributed to conservation efforts for this endangered species, resulting in a notable increase in sightings. However, the lack of alignment between these two time periods hinders further analysis. This suggests that tourism in the area may not be strongly linked to Woylie sightings, ultimately yielding an inconclusive result in terms of ecotourism.

In general, an internet search for terms such as _"Pilliga State Conservation Area,"_ _"Pilliga National Park",_ _"Woylie,"_ and _"Narrabri Surrounds,"_ or a combination of these terms, yields minimal results related to marketing efforts promoting visits to the area for Woylie sightings.

This aligns with our findings, indicating that there is little to no ecotourism activity in this area for this particular species.

## Temporal Analysis 

For the purpose of performing a temporal analysis of the tourist patterns, we will be focusing on the tourist footfalls in the Narrabri region with the highest Woylie sightings.

```{r}
library(lubridate)
temporal_data <- tourism %>% filter(Region == "Narrabri Surrounds")
temporal_data$Quarter <- as.character(temporal_data$Quarter)
quarter_split <- strsplit(temporal_data$Quarter, " ")
temporal_data$Year <- sapply(quarter_split, function(x) x[1])
temporal_data$Quarter <- sapply(quarter_split, function(x) x[2])
temporal_data$Year <- as.numeric(temporal_data$Year)

annual_data <- temporal_data %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(TotalTrips = sum(Trips))
ggplot(annual_data, aes(x = Year, y = TotalTrips)) +
  geom_line(group=1, size=1) +
  geom_point(size=3) +
  geom_smooth(method='loess', color="red", se=FALSE) +  
  annotate("text", x=2002, y=75, label="Peak in 2005", vjust=-1) +  
  annotate("text", x=2016, y=75, label="Peak around 2018", vjust=-1) +  
  expand_limits(y=0) +  
  labs(title = "Annual Trend of Trips",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Total Trips") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45, hjust=1))  


```
- This graph depicts the trend of trips over the years. 

- There are two significant peaks in the data – one in 2005 and another around 2018. The trend suggests fluctuations in the total number of trips throughout the years.

- Post-2018, there seems to be a decline in trips, but it's starting to recover towards 2022.
```{r}
ggplot(temporal_data, aes(x = Quarter, y = as.factor(Year), fill = Trips)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "darkred") +
  labs(title = "Seasonal Patterns Across Years", x = "Quarter", y = "Year") +
  theme_minimal()

```
- There appears to be an increasing trend in the number of trips from 1998 until around 2021-2022. The darker shades in more recent years, especially around 2021-2022, indicate more trips compared to the lighter shades in earlier years.

- **Q1**: The trips in Q1 seems Q1 has demonstrated fluctuations over the years, starting with low activity in the late 1990s to early 2000s, experiencing a rise in the mid 2000s, stabilizing in the late 2000s to early 2010s, and then witnessing another increase in the recent years, notably 2022.

- **Q2** : This quarter appears to have moderate activity over the years

- **Q3** :  The consistent dark shades for Q3 indicate a substantial number of trips, especially in the recent years from 2016 onwards. 

- **Q4** : Activity in Q4 is on the lower side, with lighter shades indicating fewer trips.

```{r}

grouped_data <- temporal_data %>%
  group_by(Quarter) %>%
  summarize(
    TotalTrips = sum(Trips, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
ggplot(grouped_data, aes(x = Quarter, y = TotalTrips)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Total Trips per Quarter",
       x = "Quarter",
       y = "Total Trips") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 14))
```
- The third quarter (Q3) is the most active period, suggesting factors or events in these months (July to September) that drive an increase in the number of trips.

- There is a clear progression of activity from Q1 to Q3, starting with the lowest activity in Q1 and gradually increasing to reach its pinnacle in Q3.
```{r}

all_purposes_data <- temporal_data %>%
  group_by(Quarter, Purpose) %>%
  summarize(
    TotalTrips = sum(Trips, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
all_purposes_data_filtered <- all_purposes_data %>% 
  filter(Purpose != "Total")


ggplot(all_purposes_data_filtered, aes(x = Quarter, y = TotalTrips, fill = Purpose)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~ Purpose, scales = "free_y") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Trips per Quarter by Purpose",
       x = "Quarter",
       y = "") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 14))


```
- Business trips are least frequent in the first quarter and grow progressively with the peak in Q4. This could imply end-of-year meetings, reviews, or projects that drive increased business travel.

- Visiting-related trips maintain a fairly consistent number throughout the year, suggesting that family or friend visits are evenly spread and not particularly influenced by the season.

```

Figure @fig-trend illustrates the pattern of trips for the various purposes in the Narrabri region
while figure @fig-trendanalysis provides us with an understanding of the relative trend strength and seasonality of the data pertaining to the various purposes of trips.

:::{.callout-note}
# Key takeaway
1. There is a distinct pattern in the number of trips for each of the purposes (Business,Holiday,Other,and Visiting) when analysing the tourism data for the Narrabri region.

2. There have been significant periods of time with very low business trips in this region. However, the recent business trips have been more frequent and in higher numbers.

3. As expected with most holiday trends, there appears to be a seasonality in the holiday trips for the Narrabri region. This has been additionally observed by the high seasonal strength for holiday trips in @fig-trendanalysis.

4. Additionally, there appears to be a low seasonality in the the trips relating to business, visits and "others". This means that the pattern of trips in the region for the stated purposes do not repeat itself at regular intervals.

5. There is however a high trend strength in the overall total trips as well as the visit trips based on the analysis of @fig-trendanalysis. This indicates that the total trips due to visits and the overall total trips in the region have increased over time, especially in the recent years.

#| label: fig-trendecomp
#| fig-cap: "Seasonal Decomposition of Holiday Trips in Narrabri region"
# Convert data to a ts object 
ts_data_trips <- ts(tourism_pl_grouped$Total_trips, frequency=4)

 

# Decompose the time series for average trips
decomposition_trips <- stl(ts_data_trips, s.window="periodic")

 

# Plot the decomposition
autoplot(decomposition_trips) + labs(title = "Seasonal Decomposition of Holiday Trips in Narrabri region")
```
@fig-trendecomp illustrates the seasonal decomposition of the total trips over the years in the Narrabri region. The resulting plot will typically include four components:

__Original Time Series:__ The actual data points. \
__Trend Component:__ This represents the long-term trend in the data. \
__Seasonal Component:__ This represents the seasonal pattern or periodic fluctuations. \
__Residual Component:__ This is the part of the data that is not explained by the trend or seasonal components. \

:::{.callout-note}
# Key takeaways

1. The holiday data shows that the seasonality has been more consistent in the recent years when compared to the initial years of the data.

2. The trend of the holiday data does not show a clear rise or fall of trips in the Narrabri region. The total trips are observed to vary around approximately 2000 trips
every quarter.
